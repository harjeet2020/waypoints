# Algorithms & Data Structures - Learning Journey

A structured path through algorithms and data structures, building knowledge from fundamentals to advanced patterns.

## Sections

### Fundamentals

Core concepts that underpin everything else:

- Memory Management (Stack & Heap)
- Big O Notation & Algorithmic Complexity
- Math Prerequisites

### Data Structures

Understanding how data is organized in memory:

- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
- Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables & Sets
- Trees, Heaps, Graphs

### Sorting Algorithms

Classic sorting algorithms with implementation and performance analysis.

### Algorithm Patterns

Reusable problem-solving patterns:

- Binary Search, Two Pointers, Sliding Window
- BFS, DFS, Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
