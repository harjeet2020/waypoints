# Dynamic Programming

Break problem into overlapping subproblems, store results to avoid recomputation.

## When to Use

- Optimal substructure (optimal solution from optimal sub-solutions)
- Overlapping subproblems
- Counting problems
- Optimization problems (min/max)

## The Pattern

<!-- TODO: Core intuition -->

## Approaches

### Top-Down (Memoization)

<!-- TODO -->

### Bottom-Up (Tabulation)

<!-- TODO -->

## Template Code

```javascript
// TODO: Add template for both approaches
```

## Common DP Patterns

- Linear DP
- 2D DP (Grid)
- Interval DP
- State Machine DP
- Tree DP

## Common Mistakes

- Wrong recurrence relation
- Missing base cases
- Not optimizing space when possible

## Practice Problems

<!-- TODO: Add problems by difficulty -->
