# Lowest Common Ancestor (In-Depth)

## Problem Statement

Find the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants.

## Intuition

<!-- TODO -->

## Implementation

```javascript
// TODO: BST approach and binary tree approach
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time:** O(h) for BST, O(n) for binary tree
- **Space:** O(h) recursive stack

## Variations

- LCA in BST
- LCA in Binary Tree
- LCA with parent pointers

## Practice Problems
