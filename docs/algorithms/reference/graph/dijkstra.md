# Dijkstra's Algorithm (In-Depth)

## Problem Statement

Find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

## Intuition

<!-- TODO: Greedy approach explanation -->

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

<!-- TODO: Example with diagram -->

## Implementation

```javascript
// TODO: Implementation with priority queue
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time:** O((V + E) log V) with min-heap
- **Space:** O(V)

## Variations

- Bidirectional Dijkstra
- A* (with heuristics)

## Real-World Applications

- GPS navigation
- Network routing
- Game pathfinding

## Related Algorithms

- Bellman-Ford (handles negative weights)
- Floyd-Warshall (all pairs)
